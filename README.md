I started this project, in Februrary of 2016, as a programming excercise while I was learning more about Roku Brightscript 2D gamming API.

This port was made using the [HTML5 version](https://github.com/ultrabolido/PrinceJS) (developed by @ultrabolido) as a starting point, 
and the original [Apple II Assembly](https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II ) code by Jordan Mechner as a reference for the functionalities.

There are two versions of the sprites (MS-DOS and Macintosh), all levels and cut scenes are already implemented, the only missing feature is the Flip Potion. The Shadow appearances were just implemented and will be published on the private channel on release v0.10. There are some known bugs as well. I listed all of those in the "issues" section of the repository.

I will be publishing here in the following months a simple code documentation describing the files and architecture.

If you have a Roku or Roku TV you can install the preview channel using this link: https://my.roku.com/add/PoPPreview

Below links to some preview videos I published on YouTube during the development (I will edit one for v0.10 when it's released):
