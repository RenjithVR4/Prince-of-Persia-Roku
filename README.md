I started this project as a programming excercise, while I was learning more about Roku Brightscript 2D gamming API.

This port was made using the [HTML5 version](https://github.com/ultrabolido/PrinceJS) (developed by @ultrabolido) as a starting point, 
and the original [Apple II Assembly](https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II ) code by Jordan Mechner.

There are two versions of the sprites (MS-DOS and Macintosh), all levels and cut scenes are already implemented, the major missing features are: The Shadow and the Flip Potion. There are some known bugs as well. I listed all of those in the "issues" section of the repository.

I will be publishing here later a simple code documentation describing the files and architecture.

If you have a Roku you can install the preview channel using this link: https://my.roku.com/add/PoPPreview

Below links to some preview videos I published on YouTube during the development (I will also create one for the current version soon):
