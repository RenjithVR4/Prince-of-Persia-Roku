# Prince of Persia for Roku
A port of the classic game Prince of Persia (1989) to Roku streaming devices and TVs

I started this project as a programming excercise, while I was learning more about Roku Brightscript 2D gamming API.

This port was made using the [HTML5 version](https://github.com/ultrabolido/PrinceJS) (developed by @ultrabolido) as a starting point, 
and the original [Apple II Assembly](https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II ) code by Jordan Mechner.

I will write here soon a basic documentation of the code.
